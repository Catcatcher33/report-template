# University Report Template

Here is my template structure for all of my university reports. I write all of mine in LaTeX, whenever possible.

A quick guide to the folder structure:
```txt
|- assets/  # Any images or large files
|- config/  # Configuration files
|- content/ # Report content
|- cover.tex # Cover page (customiseable)
|- main.tex # File to begin compilation from
```

This is a rough draft requested by a friend, so it may not necessarily be fully polished!
